You can use this service to:

- get on the electoral register so you can vote in elections and referendums in the UK
- opt out of the [‘open’ register](/electoral-register/opt-out-of-the-open-register) - the version of the electoral register that’s available for anyone to buy
- update your name, address or nationality by registering again with your new details (if you live in the UK)

There's a different process to [register anonymously](/government/publications/register-to-vote-anonymously), for example if you're concerned about your safety or the safety of someone in your household.

You can check if you're already registered to vote by contacting your [electoral registration office](/contact-electoral-registration-office).

^This service is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/cofrestru-i-bleidleisio).
